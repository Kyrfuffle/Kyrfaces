# Kyrfaces
**About**:
- Replaces the relationship icons with ""improved"" versions, drawn by me. Likely incompatible with other mods that replace the relationship faces.

**Credits**:
- Credit to Kisu for making KisuFaces, what I based this mod off of
- As well as credit to emd, who made the [Spore ModAPI](https://github.com/emd4600/Spore-ModAPI)
